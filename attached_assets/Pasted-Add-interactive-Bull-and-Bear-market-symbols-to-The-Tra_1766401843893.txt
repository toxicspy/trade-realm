Add interactive Bull 🐂 and Bear 🐻 market symbols to “The Trading Realm” website.

SYMBOL PLACEMENT:
- Place two large, clickable symbols in:
  - The main dashboard
  - Market pages (USA, India, Japan, Crypto)
- Symbols:
  - 🐂 Bull → Represents bullish / gaining markets
  - 🐻 Bear → Represents bearish / losing markets
- Symbols should be visually distinct with glowing effects:
  - Bull: green / gold glow
  - Bear: red / crimson glow

BEAR MODE (LOSING MARKETS VIEW):
- When a user clicks the 🐻 Bear symbol:
  - Switch the page into “Bear Market View”
  - Display a list of companies / markets that are in loss
  - Sort the list in descending order:
    - Highest loss → Lowest loss
- Each item should show:
  - Company / Market name
  - Loss amount (percentage or value)
  - A downward indicator icon
- Visual scaling:
  - The greater the loss:
    - The larger the red/downward symbol
  - Smaller losses have smaller indicators
- Add a label like:
  “Markets bleeding the most today…”

BULL MODE (GAINING MARKETS VIEW):
- When a user clicks the 🐂 Bull symbol:
  - Switch the page into “Bull Market View”
  - Display companies / markets in profit
  - Sort the list in descending order:
    - Highest gain → Lowest gain
- Each item should show:
  - Company / Market name
  - Gain amount
  - An upward indicator icon
- Visual scaling:
  - Higher gains → larger glowing green indicators
- Add a label like:
  “Markets leading the charge…”

DATA HANDLING:
- Use mock / placeholder JSON data initially, example:
  - Company name
  - Market (USA, India, Japan, Crypto)
  - Gain/Loss value
- Structure data so real-time APIs can be added later
- Filtering should NOT reload the page

INTERACTION & UX:
- Smooth transition when switching between Bull and Bear modes
- Animate sorting (fade, slide, scale)
- Highlight the active symbol (Bull or Bear)
- Allow toggling back to normal view

ROUTING & STATE:
- Mode selection (Bull/Bear) should:
  - Be stored in state
  - Optionally reflected in the URL (e.g., ?mode=bear)
- Browser back and forward buttons must work correctly

DESIGN THEME:
- Dark fantasy / futuristic trading realm
- Bull = dominance, growth, power
- Bear = pressure, decline, intensity
- Use subtle sound or motion effects (optional)

GOAL:
Clicking the Bull or Bear symbol should feel like issuing a royal command that instantly reorganizes the market intelligence, showing the strongest gains or deepest losses in a dramatic, immersive way.
