Build a modern, immersive, dark-themed trading information website called “The Trading Realm”.

CORE IDEA:
The website should feel like the user has entered a royal, fantasy-style trading universe. When users enter the site, they should feel powerful — like a king or ruler being presented with global market intelligence. The experience must be cinematic, engaging, immersive, and clearly different from traditional boring finance websites.

DESIGN & THEME:
- Dark mode by default
- Royal + futuristic theme with gold accents and glowing effects
- Fantasy / cyber trading realm vibe
- Smooth animations and transitions (fade, slide, scale)
- Subtle motion effects and hover animations
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Clean layout that feels premium, not cluttered

HOMEPAGE (LANDING EXPERIENCE):
- Full-screen cinematic landing section
- Animated headline text:
  “Welcome, Your Majesty. You have entered the Trading Realm.”
- Subtitle:
  “Global markets bow before your command.”
- Primary CTA button:
  “Enter the Realm”
- Background visuals using animated charts, glowing lines, or subtle particles
- Clicking “Enter the Realm” navigates to the main dashboard

NAVIGATION BAR (PERSISTENT):
- Visible on all pages
- Left: Site logo / title “The Trading Realm” (click navigates to Home)
- Right or center:
  - Markets dropdown: USA, India, Japan, Crypto
  - Calendar / date picker access
  - Search bar (keyword or date-based)
  - Theme toggle (dark/light)
- Mobile-responsive navigation menu

ROUTING & PAGE FLOW:
- Use React with React Router (or Next.js routing)
- Single-page app behavior (no full page reloads)
- Browser back and forward buttons must work naturally
- Page history should be maintained correctly
- Routes should reflect country and selected date

OPTIONAL UI NAVIGATION CONTROLS:
- Visible Back and Forward buttons in the UI
- Back button uses browser history
- Forward button moves forward in history

BREADCRUMBS:
- Display breadcrumb navigation on internal pages
- Example:
  Home > USA > Market Briefing > Selected Date

COUNTRY / MARKET PAGES:
Create separate pages for:
- United States (USA)
- India
- Japan
- Crypto Market

When a user selects a country or market:
- Navigate to a dedicated page
- Show latest trading-related news for that region
- Display major indices, market highlights, and key updates
- Use original, story-style summaries instead of raw news headlines
- Each page must reuse the same navbar and footer

CRYPTO SECTION:
- Dedicated Crypto Market page
- Display trending crypto news (rewritten summaries)
- Show price cards for Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.
- Use futuristic visuals and glowing card components

CALENDAR / DATE-BASED NEWS SYSTEM:
- Include a clean, modern calendar or date picker component
- Calendar should be accessible from:
  - Navigation bar
  - Dedicated “Market Archives” section
- Users can select any past or current date

DATE-BASED CONTENT LOADING:
- When a date is selected:
  - Update the URL/route with the selected date
  - Dynamically load trading and market content for that date
  - Do NOT reload the page
- Display loading state text like:
  “Retrieving market records from the archives…”
  or
  “Retrieving market records from [Selected Date]…”

DATE-BASED CONTENT DISPLAY:
- Show:
  - Market news summaries (original, rewritten)
  - Major trading or economic events of that day
  - Market mood indicator:
    Bullish 🟢 | Bearish 🔴 | Neutral 🟡
- Highlight selected date visually
- Smooth animations when date changes
- Users should be able to bookmark date-based pages

ENGAGEMENT FEATURES:
- Daily “Royal Market Briefing” section
- Market mood indicators and signals
- Hover effects revealing short insights
- Smooth page transitions and loading animations
- The site should feel alive and interactive

DATA HANDLING:
- Use placeholder or mock JSON data initially
- Structure code so real market/news APIs can be added later
- APIs should be used only for data, not direct text display
- Content must be original and rewritten (no raw API headlines)

FOOTER:
- Footer visible on all pages
- Include:
  - Disclaimer:
    “This platform provides market information only and does not offer financial advice.”

  - Copyright section

TECH REQUIREMENTS:

- Use Tailwind CSS or modern CSS styling
- Clean, modular, well-structured code

GOAL:
The website should feel like a complete, professional, immersive trading universe — a “market realm” where users explore global trading intelligence through an engaging, royal, and futuristic experience with smooth navigation, strong usability, and zero plagiarism.
